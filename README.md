# Bayesian sequence segmentation

The following guide goes through all the steps required to implement a Bayesian sequence segmentation algorithm based on *Bayesian inference on biopolymer models*.

### Contents

- Guides can be found in `/guides`.
- Working example code to be used together with the guides can be found in `/examples`.
- Figures creates by running example code can be found in `/figures`.
- Papers that the algorithms are based on can be found in `/papers`. I refer to these throughout the guides.
- In case Katex isn't rendered correctly in your favourite code editor, I have provided HTML versions of the guides.

### Guides

Guides should be read in the following order:

- [Sampling an unknown variable](guides/SEQUENCE.md)
- [Finding a single breakpoint](guides/SINGLE_BRK.md)
- [Extending the definition of a sequence](guides/MULTINOMIAL.md)
- [Brute-forcing a more complex model](guides/BRUTE_FORCE.md)
- [Optimisations with dynamic programming](guides/DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING.md)
- [Finding breakpoint locations](guides/BRK_POSITIONS.md)

Good luck!
