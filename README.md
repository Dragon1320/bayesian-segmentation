# Bayesian sequence segmentation

The following guide goes through all the steps required to implement a bayesian sequence segmentation algorithm based on *Bayesian inference on biopolymer models*.

### Contents

- Guides can be found in /guides.
- Working example code to be used together with the guides can be found in /examples.
- Figures creates by running example code can be found in /figures.
- Papers that the algorithms are based on can be found in /papers. I refer to these throughout the guides.
- In case Katex isn't rendered correctly in your favourite code editor, I have provided HTML versions of the guides.

Good luck!
